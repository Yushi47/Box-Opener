# Box Opener

A TERA Proxy module that automates item use (boxes, scrolls, consumables, etc.) in bulk.

## 📦 Usage

1. Type `!box` in chat.
2. Open your inventory.
3. Right-click any item you want to loop-use.

The script takes over and continues using it automatically. Type `!box` again to stop.

## ⚙️ Commands

- `!box`  
  Start/stop auto-use for the selected item.

- `!boxdelay <ms>`  
  Set minimum delay between uses.  
  → `!boxdelay 3000` = 3s per use  
  → `!boxdelay 0` = fastest possible
